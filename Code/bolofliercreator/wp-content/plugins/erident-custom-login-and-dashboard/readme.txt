== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it legal to change WordPress Logo and texts? =

Yes. WordPress gives you the permission to change whole login screen and dashboard to yours by using WordPress hooks.

= How can I add my own image to use as Login screen's background? =

Simply upload your image using WordPress uploader and copy the image link from there and paste it in the Custom Login and Dashboard Settings page.

= On next update will I lose my previous settings? =
By default you will not lose any of your previous settings. Check the Plugin Un-install Settings.

= I want some custom changes. How can I do that? =
You can edit the plugin's php file through WordPress plugin editor. But once you made an update the changes you made will disappear. So make sure to backup your changes before updating. Or inform us [Suggestions/requests](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/suggestionsrequests-for-future-version-update?replies=1) for future version

= Can I export settings? =
Yeah! With version 3.0 Import/Export plugin settings feature added. Your life made easy.

= How will I put opacity on Login Form =
You can achieve it by either using a transparent png/gif image or you can use the "opacity" feature added in ver:3.3 Add a background color for Login form and set an opacity to it. Default will be 1, means the background color will be opaque. changing it to 0.5 will give you 50% transparency. Just play around it. Make sure that there is no image on Login form background.
